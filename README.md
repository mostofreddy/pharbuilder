## Using Phox

### Running Phox from the command line

    phox build --src=/var/www/my_project --output=/tmp/my_dir [--alias=MyAlias] [--stub=bin/cli.php] [--stubweb=web/server.php] [--replace] [--exclude=tests] [--exclude=docs]

* output: __REQUIRED__ The full or relative path to the directory that contains all files to add.
* src: __REQUIRED__ Output directory for phar file.
* alias: Alias with which this Phar archive should be referred to in calls to stream functionality.
* stub: Path to the php file to call when Phar file is running from command line. Example: --stubweb=src/mainStubCli.php.
* stubweb: Endpoint file when the Phar file is running as a site on server (ex: virtal host on Apache or server block in Nginx). Example: --stubweb=src/mainStubWeb.php.
* replace: If the file exists, delete it.
* exclude: Directory exclusion (ex: --exclude=tests --exclude=docs). (multiple values allowed)

Example

    php phox build --src=/var/www/my_project --output=/tmp/my_dir

* phar: __REQUIRED__ Path to Phar file.

### Signature

    phox sign-create --phar=/tmp/my_dir/MyAlias.phar --output=/tmp/my_dir [--encrypt-type=SHA256]
